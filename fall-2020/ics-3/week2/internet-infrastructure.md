## Computers (and the internet) will...

### Good views

- Make us less active
- Make us isolated

## Social constructorism

- Technology is not special
- Social issues drive technological innovation
- Society shapes technology
- If society needs something, technology is invented to meet those needs

## Technological determinism

- Technology has inherent properties (cannot be controlled by humans)
- Technical innovations create social change
- Technology shapes society
- Technological creations change social needs

## Do artifacts have politics? (Langdon Winner)

- Focuses on technological determinism
- New York parkways
    - Designed to make buses avoid them
    - Perpetuated economic / racial issues
    - Designed by humans (purposefully built that way)
    - Gave parkway power over societal issues
    - Parkways have politics
- Tomato harvester
    - Faster harvesting
    - Job loss (around 32,000)
    - Designed to speed up production
    - Harvester has politics
- Design of technology
    - Impact users / designer
    - Effects linger for a long time

## Infrastructure

- Study of "boring" things
- Everything that is forgotten
- Not identified until broken
- Examples
    - Gas / water / electricity
    - Broadband
    - Roads and bridges
- Varies for individual and through time
- Transparent to use: learn once and largely ignore
- Learned as part of a membership
    - Members are use to infrastructure
    - Member do not pay attention to infrastructure
    - More visible to new members
- Embodiment of standards
    - Sets standards
    - Devices built to fit infrastructure
    - Relates to transparent use
- Built on itself
    - Expanded on older, existing infrastructure
    - Comes with unique histories
    - Improved in increments
- Invisible until it breaks
- Being closer to infrastructure is an advantage
- Nobody in charge
    - Big, layered, and complex
    - Differs by location

## Putting the internet it its place

- Infrastructure identifies where the internet is
- Under water sea cables (originally for telegraphs)
