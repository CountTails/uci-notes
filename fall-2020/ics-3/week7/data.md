- Why measure things? To understand and make claims about things
    - US census: a massive data set on the US population

    - Do you know what is collected about you?
    - Can you manage what is collected about you?
- **Data agent**: Matching data about you (with consent)
- **Data shadow**: Identifiable information used to track you
- **Data sweat**: Leaves traces of our passing

    - It lingers; we cannot control when / where it is collected
    - Tells a (super incomplete) story
- On counting
    - Contextual counting
