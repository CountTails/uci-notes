# Course introduction

## Where you've been

- First year Python programming
    - [I&C SCI 31](../../../fall-2019/ics-31/syllabus.md)
    - [I&C SCI 32](../../../winter-2020/ics-32/syllabus.md)
    - [I&C SCI 33](../../../spring-2020/ics-33/syllabus.md)
- What you should know
    - Have some depth in at least one language
    - Written programs of more than a trivial size (> 100 lines)
    - Broken larger problems into smaller ones
    - Used a variety of language features
    - Debugging techniques

## Where you're going

- C++ is a giant language
- Learning as a second language
    - Will be easier than your first because features is similar
    - Will be harder than your first because unaddressed issues must be addressed
- Approach C++ as a second language

### Design goals of C++

- Intended to be useful for systems programming
- Can be compiled down to bare machine code (makes best use of available resources)
- Can be compiled reasonably efficiently on machines of the day
- Language features should impose zero cost on those who don't use them
- C++ code should be compatible with C code wherever possible
