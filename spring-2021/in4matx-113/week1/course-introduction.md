# Course introduction

## Course basics

### What this course is about

- Equipping **YOU** to develop software systems through requirements analysis and engineering techniques
- Becoming familiar with a systematic process of developing requirements through cooperative problem analysis, representation, and validation
- Specifying *what* a proposed software system should do, *why* and for *whom* the system is needed
	- **NOT** *how* the system should do it
- Both technical and non-technical approaches to the requirements problem

### Learning objectives

- Work as a productive members of a team to:
	- Analyzed a proposed software system
	- Create and validate various requirements artifacts
		- Elicitation questions
		- Stakeholder model
		- Goal model
		- Usage model
		- Domain model
		- Requirements specification
		- User stories
- Understand and describe the following non-technical requirements-related aspects
	- Team dynamics (in the context of software engineering)
	- Requirements negotiation
	- Requirements traceability
	- Requirements management

### "Airport ideas"

1) Teamwork is a skill
2) Doing RE correctly is crucial
3) Understand the problem world
4) Figure out who you are developing for
5) Figure out the "why" behind stakeholders desires
6) Map out the functional user interaction
7) Understand the solution world
8) Be precise, verifiable, and changeable
9) Negotiate based on the merits of a problem
10) You will not get things right the first time
11) Requirements will change
12) Agile = less formality and detail in RE activities


## Teamwork

### Why teamwork?

- Central to this course and to a SE career
- You can conquer complex and challenging projects that you could not accomplish on your own
- Conflict management skills
- Multiple perspectives
- Accountability
- You learn from all aspects of teamwork, even the bad

### What makes a team?

- Members that
	- Share a common purpose
	- Recognize they belong to the team
	- Are interdependent on each other
	- Agree on norms or values that regulate their behavior

> This usually has to develop ... teams aren't born with it!

### Maxon's theory of team formation

#### Stage 1: forming

- Forming
	- Introductions, socializing
	- Team tries to come to a consensus on their purpose
	- Generally, people are on the best behavior
	- Cliques may form
	- A team leader may emerge
- Recommendations
	- Discuss team expectations
		- Establish ground rules
		- Be as specific as possible
		- Hold each other (and yourself) accountable
	- Define team roles and responsibilities
		- Facilitator: help team organize, focus, participate, and be productive
		- Recorder: maintains and distributes team records
		- Participants: generate ideas, complete tasks

#### Stage 2: storming

- Storming
	- The most painful, but most important stage
	- Role negotiation is the undercurrent
	- Competition / conflicts / battles / challenges
- Recommendations
	- Communicate! Make sure *everyone* stays in the loop
	- A goal to aim for: everyone is doing effective things, not destructive things
	- There is no cookbook strategy for getting through this phase -- it's difficult and every group is unique

> If you avoid, rather than confront conflict,  you will never reap the cognitive benefits of functioning collaboratively

#### Stage 3: norming

- Norming
	- Members collaborate rather than compete
	- Creativity increases
	- Leaders becomes facilitators
	- Teammates have roles but role boundaries are fluid
	- Teammates tolerate and compensate for each others' weaknesses
	- A team spirit is developed
- Recommendations
	- Keep up the good practices from this and previous stages

#### Stage 4: performing

- The effective patterns of behavior are now the norm
- The team achieves more than the sum of what its members could do individually
- Team has the ability to prevent or work though team problems
