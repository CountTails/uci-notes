# Learning from users

## User research

### Why conduct i?

- To help us understand a problem in context
- To help us better define our goals for addressing that problem
- For whom?
	- Who will be the users of your design?
	- What do your users want?
- To do what?
	- What problem will your design address?
	- What opportunities can you leverage in your design?
- How?
	- What are the expected requirements?
	- How do the users do it now?
	- Is there already another solution?

### Understanding a problem

- A problem is an "undesirable situation"
- Problems are often tied to specific groups of people
- A situation may be undesirable for one person but greatly desirable to another
- Understanding problems requires **communicating** with people

### What are we looking for?

- Opportunities for a new design or experience
- Breakdowns in current processes
- Workarounds people are implementing
- Mismatches between what people say and do

### 6 rules for observing people

1) Cast aside your biases, listen and observe
2) Note the contradictions between what people say and what they do
3) Listen to people's personal stories
4) Watch for "work arounds"
5) Distinguish between needs and solutions
6) Look beyond the obvious

## User research methods

### Types of method

- Quantitative/statistical
	- Expressed in numbers
	- Often used to directly test or confirm hypothesis
	- More likely to produce generalizable analysis
	- More rigid
	- Better for "what" and "how many" questions
- Qualitative/observational
	- Expressed in text/words
	- Often used to better understand experiences
	- More likely to produce in-depth insights about specific phenomena
	- More flexible
	- Better for "how" and "why" questions

### Types of data

- What people say
	- Our words can be unreliable
	- People aren't always good/consistent at
		- Summarizing or predicting behavior
		- Explaining the own behavior
		- Imagining different behavior
	- Words provide insight into values, preferences, perception, and culture
- What people do
	- Difficult to observer "why" from only behavior
		- Actions may be misinterpreted
		- Value, preferences, and cultural influences are rarely obvious
	- Direct observation can be more reliable
		- Not subject to "filtering" by participants/informants
		- Can see things that informant may not be aware of

### Ways to observe

- What people do
	- Design ethnography
	- Participant observation
	- Contextual inquiry
	- Behavioral mapping
- What people say
	- Interviews
	- Focus groups
	- Diary studies
	- Surveys
	- Cultural probes
	- Card sorting
	- Sketching and mapping

### Contextual inquiry or ethnographic interview

- Shortened version of longer ethnographic practice
- Combines immersive observation and directed interview
- Key principles
	- **Context**: interview the user in their own environment
	- **Partnership**: master/apprentice model includes both observation and discussion
	- **Interpretation**: the meaning of users' behavior is not obvious. Data must be interpreted by the designer
	- **Focus**: designer must maintain focus without being too rigid. Allow yourself to be surprised
- Question types
	- **Closed-ended questions**: simply answers, limited number or responses, yes/no
	- **Open-ended questions**: invites person answering to determine how much information to provide
- Focus on your goals
	- Trying to understand *how* and/or *why* of users
	- To (re)design tasks to better match user goals
	- Avoid making the user a designer
	- Avoid discussing technology
	- You are trying to understand the user/task not the technology
	- Encourage storytelling
- Your ethical responsibilities
	- Designer/user relationship
	- Recognize their expertise - they are helping you!
	- Protect your participants/informants
	- Privacy, harm, data safety, etc.
	- Pause for reflection: are you being true to the people your are designing for, their needs and their values?
	- Double check your interpretation with participants/informants
