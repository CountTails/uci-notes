# Introduction to human-computer interaction (HCI)

## Why HCI?

### As a discipline

Human-computer interaction is an interdisciplinary pursuit of

- Computer science/engineering
- Design
- Psychology

Human-computer interaction is studied because

- It is much more than *just* usability
- Deals with context and how designs function in the real world

### Design in context

- Designers should design with context in mind
- Consider both the common case and the uncommon case to avoid catastrophic failure
- Usability should be maintained in both uneventful and critical times

### UI/UX and usability

- A *usable* system is...
	- Easy to learn
	- Easy to remember how to use
	- Effective
	- Efficient
	- Safe
	- Enjoyable to use

### HCI and usability

- Contributes to the development of **guidelines and standards** that support design
- Suggests **methods of evaluation** that help evaluate user experience
- Supports models for **predicting system performance**
- Shapes new **interaction paradigms** or means of interacting with technology in our everyday lives

> Understanding *how* and *why* **human interactions break down** is fundamental to designing better computer systems

## A brief history of HCI

### Before modern interfaces

- Code cards: cards with punched holes that specify a computer program's instructions
- Data management systems
	- Memex: index human knowledge through association
	- Similar to modern day hyperlinks
	- Foreshadows modern systems like wikipedia

### 1960s

- Introduction of mouse and keyboards as input devices
- Dominant input device is initially the keyboard
	- Many programs had command line interfaces
	- This suited the keyboard quite well

### 1980s

- Computers become common in the workplace
- Personal computers introduced
	- No hard drives
	- No graphical user interfaces
	- Had to learn it yourself
- Graphical user interfaces bring on mass adoption of the mouse
- Creates a rush to study usability

### The early web

- A new markup language to describe the layout of a GUI
- Accessible through a web browser (no need to install anything)
- Has largely remained the same into the modern way, except
	1) Better speed
	2) Better search
	3) Move to "apps"
- Fastest internet speeds capped out at about 30 kbps
- No search engines -> no indexing of webpages, URL required
- Early sites were purely informational whereas modern sites are interactive and facilitate activity

### 21st century

#### Smart devices

- Many devices get a "intelligent" upgrade
- Functions exactly as its predecessor, but include some additional functionality
- Looks a lot better than its predecessor (sometimes)

#### Mobile devices

- Transition to touchscreen technology
	- iPhone
	- iPad
- Many laptops offer *both* touchscreen and traditional keyboard/mouse input

#### Touch-free

- Smart assistants allow interaction with voice
	- Verbally ask a question
	- Verbally get a response
- Computers that don't look like traditional computers

## Don Norman on the term "UX"

- Experience of using a computer
	- Everything from
		- Shopping
		- Buying
		- Assembling
		- Telling others
- Misused by many: often narrowed down to a single aspect of a machine

### What the #$%@ is UX design

- Everyone will have a different answer
- Everyone will agree that UX stands for **u**ser e**x**perience
- Everything that affects a user's experience with a product
- Often involves taking user and business needs into account
- A user-centered design process will account for user needs at every stage of development

### 4 reasons to learn UX design

1) You're already using it
2) User centered design is a process
3) It is not hard and easy to learn
4) It is fun an fascinating
