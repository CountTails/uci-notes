- Earlier writer involvement makes the story beter
- Writing completes character design
- Sharing narrative with entire development team
- Harder to write than a screenplay or a book
- Hollywood voice actors for dialogue in game
- Gates where all narrative in games go through
    - Fluid flow to these gates is the key to avoid criticism
