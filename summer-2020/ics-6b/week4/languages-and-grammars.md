# Languages and grammars

## Tokens

- The smallest atomic entity in a language
- Also known as a terminal
- Examples
    - Type declaration: `int`
    - Identifiers: `i`
    - Operators: `=`
    - Line breaks: `;` in C-style languages, `\n` in Pythonic languages

## Expressions

- One of the following
    - Statement
    - Sentence
    - Phrase
- Example
    - Math expression to be evaluated: `= 2 * i + 1*`

## Parse trees

- Connects the tokens that make up an expression
- Leaf nodes consist of terminals or tokens

```
        =
       / \
      i   +
         / \
        *   1
       / \
      2   i
```

## Valid sentences

- Defined by grammars
- It is the set of all valid sentences in a language
    - Terminals are tokens
    - Phrases are strings of terminals or nonterminals
- Example: "The horse runs quickly"
    - Noun phrase: "The horse"
    - Verb phrase: "runs quickly"
- Production rules
    - A sentence consists of a noun phrase and a verb phrase
    - A noun phrase consists of a noun and an article
    - A article if one of `a|an|the`
    - A verb phrases consists of a verb and an adverb
    - Words are the terminals in this language

## Phrases

- Grammars produce sentences

$$
    (\text{a, an, the}) \times (\text{horse, rabbit,} \dots) \times (\text{runs, eats}) \times (\text{quickly, slowly})
$$

- Parsing involves the following
    - Read from right to left
    - Ensure inputs follow grammar rules
- Phrases structure grammar
    - The alphabet consists of all terminals and nonterminals
    - The grammar is the cartesian product of vocab, alphabet, terminals, and production rules
- A language is generated by its production rules
    - Strings are parsed by the language
    - Symbols (tokens) make words and sentences
    - A language is the set of all valid sentences

## Types of grammars

- Regular grammars (easiest)
    - can be parsed from left to right
    - does not have ambiguity
- Context-sensitive
    - Allows for stucture like `{left}A{right}`
    - Expansion of `A` must have context
- Context-free
    - `A -> w`
- Most natural languages do not fit into a single type of grammar

## Syntax vs. semantics

- Syntax strictly checked if a sentence it correctly formatted
- Semantics checks the meaning of a sentence
- "The soldier is green"
    - The word "green" is ambiguous. It could mean the clothes, or the inexperience of the soldier
    - Humans can disambiguate from context
- "colorless green ideas sleep seriously"
    - Syntax is valid
    - Meaing is unmatched (it has no meaning)
- Compute languages have clear and unambiguous semantics
    - `i = i + 1`  has one and only one meaning: "add 1 to i"
