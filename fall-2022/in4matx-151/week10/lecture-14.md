## Storming and reforming

- There are low points for a reason

### Behavior management

#### Wong on managing behaviors

- Upper-level behaviors: Strong team player, caring, conscientious, initiator, positive
- Lower-level behaviors: Non-contributor, resistant to change, unreliable, negative
- More to know for the final
- Project managers should aim to move lower-level behaviors into the upper-level

#### What to do when you encounter a difficult person

- Do not join in, do not feed
- Practice positive behavior
- Address their fears
- Do not take personally, get upset
- Feel empathy on their situation

#### Strategies for handling difficult people

- Complainer? Turn complaints into a problem-solving exercise
- Dominance? Redirect focus to work/content
- Controllers? Foster greater team communication/assessment
- Impatience? Reflect on and actively track time/strong time management practices

#### Strategies for keeping people in the upper level

- Recognition, respect, and trust
- Rotate roles and responsibilities
- Include everyone on meeting agendas
- Match tasks to skills/strengths
- Encourage involvement
- Set behavioral expectations
- Be transparent

### Dysfunction of teams (Lencione on *The Five Dysfunctions of a Team*)

#### An absence of trust among team members

The problem: The confidence among team members that their peers' intentions are good... and that there is no reason to be protective or careful around the group

- Discuss personal histories
- Team effectiveness exercise
- Personality types and behavioral preference tools
- Experiential team exercises

#### Fear of conflict

The problem: Conflict is considered taboo. Even though conflict can be productive, nobody wants to hurt their teammates' feelings. Ignoring conflict can lead to boiled over emotions.

- Acknowledge conflict is productive
- Mining(extract information from people)
- Do not let desire to protect from harm interrupt disagreement

#### Lack of commitment

The problem: Not everyone will agree all the time, risking to **no** decision, rather than **a** decision. Often ties into fear of conflict, not everyone willing to put ideas on the table

- Cascading messaging. Leave meetings with clear team alignment
- Contingency plans and worst-case scenario analysis
- Clear deadlines to pressure decisions

#### An avoidance of accountability

The problem: Lack of willingness by team members to call out their peers on performance or negative behaviors

- Peer pressure
- Regular progress reviews
- Team rewards

#### Inattention to results

The problem: Focusing on something other than the collective group goals

- Recognize results are not critical or important to all teams
- Publicly declare results
- Results-based awards (something non-financial/fun)
