### Fitness for use

Generally...

- Ensure a product can be used as intended
- Ensure that a project satisfies the needs for which it was undertaken

To achieve: `Plan -> Manage -> Control`

### Plan

- Review materials generated through scope statement and WBS
- What aspects of scope *could* affect quality?
	- Functions and features
	- System outputs
	- System performance
	- Reliability and maintainability

### Manage

Ensuring project quality

- Quality assurance (QA)
- Benchmarking
- Quality audit

### Control

Quality control

- Acceptance
- Rework
- Process adjustment

```
        +--------------| Rework |
		|                   ^
		|                   | Reject
		V                   | 
| Acceptance | ---->  Accept/Reject? 
                            | 
                            | Accept
                            V        No
                          Rework?  ----> | Complete |
                            |
                            +----------> | Process adjustments |
                                 Yes
```

### Measuring, monitoring, and managing quality

Cause and effect

- What is the problem?
- Why could this happen?
	- Why??
		- Why???
			- Why????
				- Why?????
- What is the solution?
- How do we prevent?

Decision making

- What is the problem?
- What is the source?
- When did it occur?
- What is the frequency of occurence?

Collect data and use various tools for visualization

- Tables
- Scatter charts
- Histograms

## Case study

User complaints

- Messages are frequently delayed, slow
- Users report that sent messages are often neve received or skipped during a conversation
