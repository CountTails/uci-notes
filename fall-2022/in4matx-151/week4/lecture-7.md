## Schedule managements

### Defining tasks/activities

- Scope and WBS provide clear and concise overview of requirements
- **Work packages**(scope) detail what is required to complete a WBS item
- **Activities**(time) describe how the work outlined in the work package should be completed
	- Activities decompose a work package
	- Activities inform how work is carried out, how long it will take, and how to control the schedule
	- Activities allow for more accurate time and resource estimates

### Activity list

Consist of 

- an activity ID
- an activity name
- an activity description
- activity attributes

Attributes should include schedule related information

### Sequencing activities

- sequencing identifies an ordering relationship between activities (activity B cannot start before activity A)
- Relationships can be
	- Mandatory
	- Discretionary
	- External
	- Internal
- Can be visualize through a network diagram
	- Only include activities with dependencies

### Sequencing diagram

Activity on Arrow (AOA)/Arrow diagramming

- $n$ is the sequence or activity completion order
- $X=n$ is the activity and duration (days, weeks, etc)

Precedence diagramming

- Table represents an activity
- More common in practice
- More expressinve than AOA

### Scheduling estimates

- Based of **duration** not *effort*
- Say an activity takes 40 hours to complete
- If 4 developers work on it for 7 hours a day
- Then work estimate is $40/(4*7) = 1.5$ days
- Round up, so the work estimate would be 2 days
