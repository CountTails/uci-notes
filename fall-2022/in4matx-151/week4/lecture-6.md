## Scope management

### Processes

1) Planning
2) Collecting requirements
3) Defining the scope
4) Creating a work breakdown structure
5) Scope verification
6) Scope control

### Plan

a plan for the plan -- a brief document that describes how key aspects of the scope statement will be managed

- How the team will prepare the scope
- How the team will create the WBS
- How project deliverables will be verified when completed
- How change requests to project scope will be managed

### Requirements

A condition or capability needed by a **user to achieve** or a **system to satisfy** an objective

Each requirement should assess

- Time
- Cost
- Implementation

Requirement collection can occur through

- Interviews
- Workshops or focus groups
- Observation
- Questionaires and surveys
- Group activities

Requirements should be categorized by the following types

- Functional
- Service
- Performance
- Quality
- Training

Documentation or the requirement traceability matrix (RTM) includes

- Req No: a unique identifier for a particular requirements
- Name: a short description (1-3 sentences) for the requirement
- Category: the category the requirement belongs to
- Source: Location of original input that generated the requirement
- Status: Up-to-date status of a requirement

### Scope definition

Good definition of scope helps improve the accuracy of time, cost and resource estimates

Scope statements should include the following

- Project description
- User acceptance criteria
- Overall objectives and justification
- Detailed descriptions of project deliverables
- Characteristics and requirements of products and services produced
- Success criteria

May also include

- Scope boundaries
- risks
- milestones
- approval requirements
- cost estimates

May not be done correctly the first time; start with a preliminary statement and iterate until you feel you have captured the project as best as possible

### Work breakdown structure

- Organization of all deliverables identified through requirement gathering process
- Critical for **all** projects...source for schedules, costs, resources, and changes

### Scope verification

- Validation and acceptance of **completed** project deliverables
- Often completed with project stakeholders according to processes established inscope statement

```
Documentation --------+         Inspection
                      |             |
Project deliverable --+ ------------+------------> Accepted deliverable
                      |             |
Performance data -----+        Decision making
```

### Scope control

The process of controlling changes that may occur over the life of the project

Change is inevitable! Scope control defines how you manage that change

- Influence actors that cause changes to scope
- Assure changes are processed according to established procedures
- Monitor and manage changes when they *must* occur

The best way to control change is to mitigate the risk of change

- Regular meetings
- Include users as often as possible/add to team/cross pollinate
- Deliver *something* on a regular basis
- Do not overpromise and underdeliver

## Work breakdown structure

A *breakdown* of the tasks necessary to complete a project deliverable

The WBS is organized by **levels**

- level 1: should represent the entire project
- level 2: main products to be delivered
- level 3: individual items the comprise level 2 deliverables

Two common methods of WBS representation are **Tabular** and **Chart** form

#### Tabular

```
1. Website update
	1.1 Planning
		1.1.1 Evaluate current systems
		1.1.2 Define requirements
		1.1.3 Define specific functionality
		1.1.4 Define risks and risk management approach
		1.1.5 Develop project plan
	1.2 Website design
	1.3 Website development
	1.4 Deployment
	1.5 Support
```

#### Chart

```
Level 1 ----------------------------> Website update

Level 2 ----> Planning ----> Website development ----> Website design
				|
				|
				+ --> Evaluate current system
				|
				|
				+ --> Define requirements
Level 3 ------->|
				|
				+ --> Define functionality
				|
				|
				+ --> Define risks
```

### Work package

A collection or related requirements that accommodate time, cost, and resource requirements

This is the lowest level tasks on your WBS

The work package for `Evaluate current system` might look like

1) Schedule system walkthrough and meeting with team and management
2) Assign `<name>` to lead
3) Record meeting using `X` system
4) Disseminate results on Intranet
5) Gather feedback from stakeholders

### Strategies for developing a WBS

- Apply guidelines, PMI has a practice standard you can follow
- Use analogies; Model your WBS after similar projects
- Use top-down or bottom-up approach
- Use mind mapping. Free form or non-linear structure for capturing tasks and tasks breakdown

#### Mind mapping

- Central node to represent the overall tasks
- Subtaks and work package tasks connected via lines
- Can be combined with other approaches

#### The WBS dictionary

- Provides detailed explanation about each item in the WBS
- *Not* definition of *terms* (fine to have, but put in appendix)
- Typically a short paragraph that describes each work package

#### General advice

- Identifying requirements is hard! Practice and experience make it easier
- Only one person should be responsible for a given WBS item's completion
- Do not develop WBS in isolation; include as many stakeholders as possible
- Ensure that each item in the WBS is in the dictionary
