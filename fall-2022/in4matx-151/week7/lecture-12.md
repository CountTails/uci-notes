## People management 

### Human resources

- US ranks #1 in productivity when calculating GDP per worker
- US is not #1 when calculating GDP per hours worked

> Twice as many Americans than Europeans work more than 48 hours per week

> Europeans average 6-7 weeks of paid leave. US average after 5 years is 15 days

### Surroundings

- Surrounding can affect the attitude of workers
- Open, colorful, and natural-lit places are nice
- Monotone, structured, and artificially lit places are not so nice

## Resource management

Resource management is about managing people and ensuring that they do what they are hired to do

- Define roles, responsibilities, and reporting rules
- Acquire personnel, assign to above
- **But also** develop team skills, foster growth, and mentorship
- Track performance, **motivation**, feedback and conflict resolution

### Motivation

- **Intrinsic** motivation = people do things for their own enjoyment
- **Extrinsic** motivation = people do things to avoid a penalty or for a reward

Maslow hierarchy of needs

1) Self actualization: Vitality, creativity, self-sufficiency, authentcity, playfulness, and meaningfulness
2) Self esteem
3) Love and belongingness
4) Safety and security
5) Physiological needs: Air, water, food, shelter, sleep

McClelland's acquired needs theory

1) Achievement: Need to have challenging projects; regular feedback from management and peers
2) Affiliation: Desire harmonious relationships; need a cooperative work environment
3) Power: Should have the oppurtunity to manage others

McGregor's theory X and theory Y

- Theory X
    - Assumes workers dislike work
    - Requires coercion, threats, and control
- Theory Y
    - Assumes workers consider work natural
    - Self-esteem and self-actualization
- Theory Z
    - Emphasizes trust, quality, collective decision making cultural values

Generally, data consistently showed

- Projects are more likely to fail if project managers rely on **authority, money, or penalty**
- Projects were more likely to succeed if project managers relied on work **challenges and expertise**

Some techniques

- Observe and communicate (listen)
- Performance appraisals
- Conflict management
- Issue logs
- Develop strong interpersonal skills
