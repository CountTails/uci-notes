## Project management process groups

- Occur in parallel with the project development life cycle
- More strict than the project development life cycle
- They *might* align, but do **not** equate to the development life cycle
	- Initiating
		- Define and construct what project is and the phases
		- Occurs during each phase
		- Includes tasks and actions necessary to begin a phase
	- Planning
		- Develop a plane to ensure goals are met
		- Includes scope, schedule, costs, procurement and so on
		- Highly mutable - Evolves with the projects
	- Executing
		- Coordination of resources
		- Role assignments, evolving
	- Monitor and control
		- Oversight of executing processes
		- Measure and monitor project/phase progress
		- Outcomes of measurement can influence changes to other process groups
		- Necessary to keep project on track
	- Closing
		- Acceptance and closure
		- Archive materials
		- Completing documentation
		- Conducting reviews and reflection

### Adhering to process groups

- Reduce execution time
- Potential cost saving
- Reduce time to market

## Project integration management

- Coordination of all other project knowledge areas
- Coordination with the broader goals of the organization
- Integration management involves seven primary activities

1) Develop the project charter
	- Decument that formally recognizes the project's existence (signed by key stakeholders)
	- Provides direction on the project's objectives and management

	- Can incorporate
		- Contracts, statement of work
		- Environmental factors
		- Organizational assets
	- Stakeholder analysis
		- a document that contains a list of key stakeholders
		- Can includes names, roles, interesting/unique facts, level of interest/influence and suggestions for managing relationships
2) Develop project scope statement
	- Document used to develop and confirm a common understanding of the project scope
	- Used to prevent scope creep
	- Can include
		- Core requirements (must haves)
		- Enhancements (nice to have)
		- Future features (wish list)
3) Develop project management plan
	- All documents required to coordinate the project plan
	- Guides execution and monitor/contol phases
	- Can include
		- Intro/overview of project and team
		- Description of project organization (roles, responsibilities)
		- Management and technical process employed
		- Work to be done, the schedule, and budget
4) Direct and manage project execution
	- Managing and performing to work
	- Leadership, politics, communication skills are all critical during this phase
	- Majority of tool use during this phase
5) Monitor and control project work
	- Collect, measure, and disseminate performance information
	- Apply corrective actions as needed
	- Proactively take preventive actions as process changes are identified
6) Perform integrated chagne control
	- Formal, documented process that describes when and how project resources change
	- Documents who is authorized to make changes
	- *change happens... plan accordingly*
7) Close the project
	- Finalize all activities and transfer completed work to the appropriate resources
		- Administrative closure procedures
		- Contract closures
		- Final product, services, results
		- Organizational process updates
