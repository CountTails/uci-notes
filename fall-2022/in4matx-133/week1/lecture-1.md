# Lecture 1: History of user interfaces

## Product design process

1) Ideate: come up with as many as possible
2) Refine: reduce ideas from earlier
3) Design: plan out implementation
4) Implement
5) Test
6) Deploy

### User interface implementation

- Can turn ideas into reality
- Dictates design decisions and timelines
- Either will implement or communicate with colleagues who implement UI

### What is interface implementation today?

- HTML: Layout
- CSS: Style
- JavaScript: Interactivity

There are many tools that provide abstractions to the technology listed above

### Why use web tools?

- convenient
- less client-side reliance

## A brief overview of computing history

### The computer for the 21st century

- Mark Weiser, 1991, coined the term **Ubiquitous Computing**

- There are 3 waves of computing

### Mainframe computing

This first wave has a many-to-one relationship. Many people one machine.

#### Computers were

- large (take up a whole room)
- expensive (10s of thousands of dollars)
- primarily used to perform calculation

#### Writing code for the mainframe (batch process)

- Write code on punch cards
- Wait for your turn
- Run program, hope that it works
- If something goes wrong, fix it yourself and wait for next turn
- Efficient use of computing resources, but poor interactivity

#### Memex

- speculative design for personal computers
- can link information across devices and sources
- pen-based annotations of primary sources

#### Command line interfaces (CLI)

- Orignially a terminal connected to a mainframe
- Can change execution based on ouput
- Enabled real-time debugging

### Personal computing

#### Comercial debut

- introduced by Xerox in 1973
- had a mouse and a chording keyboard
- comercially unsucessful
- software could now runs in windows (portion of a screen)
- desktop with icons
	- navigate between files and programs
- slow...

#### The rise of personal computing

This wave ahs a one-to-one relationship. Each person has their own computer.

##### Operating systems

- Apple's Macintosh released in 1984
- Microsoft's Windows version 1.0 released in 1985
- The Macintosh featured a graphical user interface, whereas initial versions of Windows used mostly CLls
- GUI became mainstream in Windows version 3.0
	- used games to teach mouse skills

##### Web browsers

- Mosaic web browser released in 1993
- It was the first graphical web browser
- Microsoft's Internet Explorer joined the party in 1995
- Apple's Safari did not show up until 2003

### Ubiquitous computing

This wave has a one-to-many relationship. Each person has multiple computing devices.

#### Types of devices

- Tabs: inch-scale devices, like a postit
- Pads: foot-scale devices, like paper
- Boards: yard-scale devices, like a whiteboard

#### Modern counterparts

- Tabs = phones and watches
- Pads = tablets and laptops
- Boards = interactive projectors? smart TVs? augmented reality?

There is still a strong sense of ownership. There may be indidual accounts, but still under the control of a single person and not publicly accessible.

## Why web tools?

### One-to-many, synced over the cloud

- Use HTTP request to send and receive data. 
	- achieved with javascript early on
- Render data with HTML
- Style it with CSS

### Web tools as the standard

- every platforms needs to be able to communicate
- most web browsers are capable and available
- shared programming language and development
	- write one, run anywhere
