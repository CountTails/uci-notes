# Lecture 1: History of user interfaces

## Product design process

1) Ideate: come up with as many as possible
2) Refine: reduce ideas from earlier
3) Design: plan out implementation
4) Implement
5) Test
6) Deploy

### User interface implementation

- Can turn ideas into reality
- Dictates design decisions and timelines
- Either will implement or communicate with colleagues who implement UI

### What is interface implementation today?

- HTML: Layout
- CSS: Style
- JavaScript: Interactivity

There are many tools that provide abstractions to the technology listed above

### Why use web tools?

- convenient
- less client-side reliance

## A brief overview of computing history

Mark Weiser, 1991, coined the term **Ubiquitous Computing**

There are 3 waves of computing

### Mainframe computing

Computers were typically large and expensive machines. Devised to help with calculations.

Batch process

- Write code on punch cards
- Wait for your turn
- Run program, hope that it works
- If something goes wrong, fix it yourself and wait for next turn
- Efficient use of computing resources, but poor interactivity

This first wave has a many-to-one relationship. Many people one machine.

Command line interfaces

- Orignially a terminal connected to a mainframe
- Can change execution based on ouput
- Enabled real-time debugging

### Personal computing

First introduced by Xerox. Included a screen, keyboard, and a mouse. Commercially unsuccessful because they were still expensive and there were too few applications to justify

Software could now run in windows (portion of a screen). The use of icons for navigating windows, menus and filesystems becomes mainstream.

The operating system wars begin. Microsoft's early windows versions were mostly command line while macontosh was primarily a graphical environment.

The web browser allows resources on other machines to be presented in a graphical manner.

This wave ahs a one-to-one relationship. Each person has their own computer.

### Ubiquitous computing

- Tabs: inch-scale devices, like a postit
- Pads: foot-scale devices, like paper
- Boards: yard-scale devices, like a whiteboard

Devices would have shared ownership. Nobody would actually own them. They would be openly available for anyone to sit and do their work. This lines up fairly well with what we use today

- Tabs = phones and watches
- Pads = tablets and laptops
- Boards = interactive projectors? smart TVs? augmented reality?

There is still a strong sense of ownership. There may be indidual accounts, but still under the control of a single person and not publicly accessible.

This wave has a one-to-many relationship. Each person has multiple computing devices.

## Why web tools?

Use HTTP request to send and receive data. Data can be synced over the cloud and shared by any device.

Every platforms needs to be able to communicate. This is done with a web browser, which most platforms have.

A shared programming language and development environment enables efficient works. A write once, run anywhere idea
