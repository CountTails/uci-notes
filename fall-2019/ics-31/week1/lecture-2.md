## Computers and Programs / Computer Tour

The CPU can handle *thousands* of instructions per second

Programs are encoded and stored in memory as 1's and 0's

The CPU's job is to fetch and execute instructions

Computers use several types of memory

- Registers -> super fast, crazy expensive, tiny capacity
- CPU cache -> faster, pricey, small capacity
- RAM -> fast, reasonably priced, average capacity
- Disk -> average speed, fairly cheap, large capacity

## Example Programs

### Salary calculation

```python
hourly_wage = 20

print('Annual salary is: ')
print(hourly_wage * 40 * 50)
print()

print('Monthly salary is: ')
print((hourly_wage * 40 * 50) / 12)
print()

```
