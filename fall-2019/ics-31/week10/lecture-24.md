## Dictionary methods

Plenty of methods to do things with dictionaries

These are already defined, and can be used right out of the box

Can only be used with `dict` objects

A complete list of `dict` methods can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_dictionary.asp)

## Nested dictionaries

Dictionaries can have dictionaries in them

Dictionaries cannot be the keys of a dictionary because dictionaries are mutable

Dictionaries can be the value in the key-value pair of a dictionary
