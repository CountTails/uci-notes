# Curves Defined by Parametric Equations
## Functions

$$ f(x) = x^{2} $$ 

- f(x) is a function
- defines an input x and an output y

Q: Can *any* curve on a plane be the graph of a function

A: Not neccesarily

## Parametric Curves

Imagine a paritcle that moves along a curve `C`. Then both of `x` and `y` coordinates of `C` are functions of time.

$$ x = f(t) $$
$$ y = g(t) $$

A curve `C` determined by the parametric equations `x = f(t)`  and `y = g(t)` is called a **parametric curve** with parameter *t*

- `(f(a), g(a))` is the initial point
- `(f(b), g(b))` is the terminal point

## Cycloid

A curve traced out by a point `P` on the circumference of a circle

$$ x = \theta M - rsin(\theta) = r\theta - sin(\theta) = r(\theta - sin(\theta))$$
$$ y = r - CM = r - rcos(\theta) = r(1 - cos(\theta))$$
