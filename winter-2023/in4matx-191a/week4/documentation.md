# Documentation

## In agile

> **Working software** > comprehensive documentation

## What is documentation?

- A thinking aid (to help figure out what to do)
- A communication and collaboration tool
- A historical artifact from a moment in the development process
- A visible representation of the work you've been doing

## Documentation should not be

- Produced after it is useful
- Kept to oneself
- Produced after the fact to justify decisions
- Created just for the sake of having documentation
- Considered precious

## Produce documentation as you work

- User stories and requirements
- Personas, user journeys, & UX documents
- UML and technical diagramsn
- Design documents

## Requirements & design document (assignment)

- Due at the end of every even-numbered sprint (first due: Feb. 17)
- Porfolio of all documentation created by your team to date
- Growing and evolving document -- each submission will add to existing document
- Representation of the software design work you have been doing

## Prioritizing User Stories

- Once you have user stories, it is important to assign a priority to each
- Priorities are based on the value provided by the user story
- Priorities are typically determined by the product owner
    - Here, in discussion between you and project partner

### Prioritization matrix

|   | High effort | Low effort |
|---|---|---|
| High priority | Important but difficult | Easy wins |
| Low priority | Why bother? | Stretch goals |

### Prioritization methods

- Recommended
    - Simple numeric: usually 1 (highest) to 3 (lowest)
    - MoSCoW: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have
- Other methods
    - RICE: separate ratings for each (reach, impact, confidence, effort)
    - Kano
    - Walking skeleton
    - Weighted shortest job first
- Other factors that could be included
    - Urgency
    - Impact
    - Risk
    - Complexity
    - Dependecies

## Don't conflate priorites and estimates

- **Prioritization**: Based on value of the item to the system
    - Ignore the amount of effort needed
- **Estimation**: Based on the effort required to implement this item
    - Determined by the dev team
