# Backlogs

## Product backlog

- Ordered list of items neeed to improve the product as a whole
- Usually ordered by priority

## Sprint backlog

- Items from the product backlog that have been selected for the current spring
- Slightly overpromise
    - Don't leave "free time" in a sprint
    - Don't overwhelm team
    - Should accomplish about 80%
    - Unfinished items go back to product backlog

## Kanban

- A visual/concptual framework for manageing development work
- Tasks are put on cards that are visually moved throught a representation of the workflow called a Kanban board

| To do | Doing | Done |
| ----- | ----- | -----|
| upcoming task | current task | previous task |

## Making kanban work

- Before starting work, open the board and see if there are updates
- When starting a new task, move card to "doing"
- When finishing an item, move card to "done"
- Alert members to assignment and signal to team members what you need
