# Software engineering review

## Sofware engineering is hard

- NO silver bullet
- Software development is hard -- need processes to help
- Software should be engineered via a defined process

## Software processes

- Build and fix
- Waterfall (and how crap it is, but still used)
- The spiral model (risk analysis + waterfall + verification with iteration)
- The rational unified process (workflows can happen in parallel)
- Extreme programming (reject strict processes, focus on the code)
- Agile (Idividuals, working software, customer collaboration, responding to change)

## Scrum

### Components

- Product backlog: agile version of requirements
- Spring backlog: set of tasks to be developed and delivered
- Product increment: Product version (sort of)

### Roles

- Scrum master: knows the process
- Project manager: manages the project team
- Product owner: manages the product
