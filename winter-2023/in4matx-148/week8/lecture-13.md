### Rest

- 

### XML

- Markup language similar to HTML

### JSON

### MQTT

## Trust and IoT

- Enormous diversity of hardware, OS, software, and manufactureres make it difficult oto establish standard IoT security and privacy-protecting solutions
- Basic security measures does not protect against these IoT botnet attacks, privacy threats

### Building trust in IoT

1) Social engineering
2) Attacks on hosted components
3) Hacked device software
4) Physical attack
5) Security misconfiguration

> There is no "magic bullet." Thinking about security before an IoT applicaiton is developed and deployed should be an integral part of the design

## Webhook
