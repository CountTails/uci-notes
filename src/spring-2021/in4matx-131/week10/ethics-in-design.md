# Ethics in design

## Traditional HCI/UX values

### Make things better

- Efficient
- Easier to learn
- Accessible
- Adopted/used
- Pleasurable
- Worthwhile

### Conflicting values

- Most profitable is often not the most accessible
- Most efficient is often not fun

## Basic ethic principles

- **Respect for autonomy**: allow people to make decisions in their own lives
- **Beneficence**: work to do good
- **Nonmaleficence**: do no harm
- **Justice**: treat all people equally, fairly, and impartially

### ACM code of ethics

- Contribute to society and human well-being
- Avoid harm to others
- Be honest and trustworthy
- Be fair and take action not to discriminate
- Honor property rights
- Give proper credit
- Respect the privacy of others
- Honor confidentially

### Big ethical issues in tech

- Access and inclusion
- Privacy and surveillance
- Algorithmic decision making
- Disinformation
- Categorization and naming
- Fair markets and monopolies

### Ethics and design

- We must ask not just "can we" but "should we"
- Consider unintended consequences
- Ethics is more about process but rules

## Dark patterns

- A user interface that has been carefully crafted to trick users into doing things
- Crafted with deliberate use (or misuse) of affordances, signifiers, and other principles
- Prioritize company interests over good user experience

### Privacy zuckering

- Make it difficult to control privacy settings
- Not immediately clear what data is used for

### Roach motel

- Make it unnecessarily difficult to unsubscribe
- Initially trapped into subscribing in the first place

### Hobson's choice

- "Take it or leave it"
- Seems like a choice, but the choice is to either accept something or get nothing
- Common for many technological platforms

### Bait and switch

- Take a design pattern people know, and change the effect to trick them
- Many clicked something anticipating a certain outcome
- An alternative, smaller method that is deliberately different required to achieve desired outcome

### Trick questions

- Use unusual wording in questions to promote unintended actions
- "Required opt-out" (unchecking a box) is a more benign alternative

### Confirmshaming or manipulinks

- Use shame to manipulate users
	- Preventing an opt-out or encourage an opt-in
- Usually done through wording

## Tools for ethical design

### Ethical explorer pack

- Tools for exploring ethical issues with design settings
- Individual and group exercises to explore "tech risk zones"

### Guiding principles

- **Support human values**: be intentional about building tech that values fundamental human rights, empowers users, and creates healthy online experiences
- **Create a culture of questioning**: recognize, challenge, and question the decisions we make. The more we use our voices, the more we'll inspire others to do the same
- **Ignite change through dialogue**: Start small, discover common ground and empower your team to create human-centered technology - one conversation at a time

### Exploring the tech risk zones

- *Surveillance*: do we offer transparency on data collection?
- *Disinformation*: do we promote the truth or ignoring the truth?
- *Exclusion*: how do we enable or encourage accessibility?
- *Algorithmic bias*: do we expose bias or misuse context?
- *Addiction*: do we promote a healthy relationship with technology or excessive use?
- *Data control*: how will we enable transparency?
- *Bad actors*: how will we promote civility?
- *Outsized power*: how will we promote choice?
