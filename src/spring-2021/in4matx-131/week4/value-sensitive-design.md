# Value sensitive design

## Technologies

- Tools: artifacts that argument human activity
- Technology: application of scientific knowledge
- Infrastructure: physical and organizational structures
- Not just things, but also policies
	- Augments and mediates human activity
	- Is about the systematic application of craft

> Technology is so much more than computing devices and software

## Stakeholders

- People or entities who are or will be significantly implicated by a technology
- Anyone who will be affected, directly or indirectly, by the technology
- **Direct stakeholders**: directly interacting with the system, the intended targets of design
- **Indirect stakeholders**: affected by the system, but not hands-on

## Human values

- Human welfare
- Ownership and property
- Privacy
- Freedom from bias
- Universal usability
- Trust
- Autonomy
- Informed consent
- Accountability
- Identity
- Calmness
- Environmental sustainability

> Value sensitive design is not meant to prescribe what is right or to answer ethical rebates
> Instead, it is meant to support designers in *actively investigating and navigating ethics in design*
