# Principles and heuristics

## Norman's 7 principles of design

1) Discoverability
2) Feedback
3) Conceptual model
4) Affordances
5) Signifiers
6) Mapping
7) Contraints

## Extending the 8 golden rules

1) Strive for consistency -> always do the same things the same way
2) Seek universal usability -> try to make your designs as accessible as possible
3) Offer informative feedback -> your design responds to actions (not technical issues)
4) Design dialogs to yield closure -> users know when actions are complete
5) Prevent errors -> build safety nets *into* your design
6) Permit easy reversal of actions -> an undo button of some kind
7) Keep users in control -> users should be able to do what they want
8) Reduce short-term memory load -> about things **within your design**

## Nielson's 10 heuristics

1) Visibility of system status
2) Match between system and the real world
3) User control and freedom
4) Consistency and standards
5) Error prevention
6) Recognition rather than recall
7) Flexibility and efficiency of use
8) Aesthetic and minimalist design
9) Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10) Help and documentation

## Heuristic evaluation

- Researchers/designers use a checklist of usability "heuristics" or principles
	- Most famous: Nielson's 10
	- Could also the 8 golden rules
- Experts evaluate interface compared to checklist
	- Go through several times thinking about different features
- Multiple experts are best
	- Each evaluates alone, without communicating
	- Combine results after evaluations
