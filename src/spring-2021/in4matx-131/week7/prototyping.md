# Prototyping

## What are prototypes?

> A simulation or sample version of a final product, which is used for testing prior to launch

### Why use them?

- Test ideas before full development
- Soliciting user feedback
- Making changes can be inexpensive and rapid compared to full products
- Compare multiple potential designs

### Factors to consider when prototyping

- Audience
	- Designers
	- Coders
	- Users
	- Sponsors
- Goals
	- Explore design possibilities
	- Map user flow
	- Emotional reaction
	- Fit to real world conditions
	- Communicate design decisions
- What is represented
	- Physical properties and constraints
	- Layout
	- Look and feel
	- Interactivity

### Prototyping choices

- Materials
	- Pen and paper
	- Cardboard
	- Physical representations
	- Digital
- Fidelity
	- How "true to life" it is
- Functionality
	- Non-function representations may use cheap materials
	- Functional representation may require more expensive materials

## Prototyping tools

### Matching fidelity

- Lower fidelity suggests openness
	- Design team and users will feel more empowered to suggest changes
	- Critiques tend to be deeper, focused on structure and process
	- Better to identify *what* a design will be
- Higher fidelity representations feel closed
	- Suggests that design decisions have already been finalized
	- Critiques will focus on look-and-feel, easy-to-change details
	- Better at confirming *how* a design will be

### Storyboards

- Illustrating time
	- Come from film and animation
	- Give a "script" of important event
	- Convey procedural information that would be difficult to understand in just text or a single image
- Show context
	- Characters
	- Setting and environment
	- Sequence
		- What **task** is being accomplished
		- What leads a person to use your technology
		- What steps are involved
	- Satisfaction
		- What is the motivation for the user?
		- What is the end result?
		- Wheat need are you satisfying?
- Level of detail
	- Text is often necessary, but keep it short
	- Convey the **experience** of using the system
	- 4-6 frames is ideal for end users, design clients may require more

### Wireframes

- Shows layout and structure without content
	- Sometimes shows rough versions of graphic elements
	- Text as will be used for buttons and other controls
- Interface elements
	- Use black and white components
	- Use dummy text
- Annotating your wireframes
	- Keep them short and to the point
	- Focus on user benefits
	- Use numerical circles to order them
	- Locate explanations to the right of the wireframe
	- Use consistent terminology for objects

## Prototype progression

### Increasing fidelity

- Deepen your wireframe
	- Add additional elements
	- Error messages
	- Deeper pages
- Create a mockup
	- Add more realistic graphics & visual design
	- Include real text
- Create a prototype
	- Add interactivity (clickable areas)
	- Application without code

### Digital tools

- Many tools available
	- Many try to cover the entire process
	- Wireframes -> mockups -> prototypes -> code
- Better for convergence (don't support sketching well)
