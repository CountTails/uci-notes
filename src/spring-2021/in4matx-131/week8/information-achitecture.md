# Information architecture

## What is it?

- The *structural* design of information environments
- Organizing and labeling of entities
- Focusing on categories of information

## Consequences of classification

- Categories have power in our lives and societies
- Categories can shape the way we understand and act in the world
- How can you define a database when there is disagreement on definitions?

## Categories and design

- Information architecture is a key part of design
- There is no perfect categorization
	- Categories are relative and cultural
	- Categories are *not* neutral
- A human-centered approach can improve findability, usability, and overall user experience

## Card sorting

- A technique for understanding how people categorize
	1) Put items on cards
	2) Ask the participants to sort the cards into groups
- **Open (free) sort**: users can choose category names
- **Closed sort**: category names are pre-defined
- Use the results to guide the hierarchy in your interface
