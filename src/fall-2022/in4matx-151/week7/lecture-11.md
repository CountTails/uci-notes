## People management

### Individual differences

- Many characteristics of human beings determine how we **feel** and how we **behave**
- **Personality** is shown to affect a lot of the behaviors that humans exhibit
- Personality is mostly stable but *can* be affected by context and context change

### Getting along

- Myers-Briggs type indicator
- Based on the work of the psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Carl Jung's pyschological types
    - Katharine Briggs and Isabel Briggs Meyer distilled Jung's work into a self reporting questionaire
    - Frequently criticized as pseudoscience ... but not the point
- MBTI dimensions
    - Extraversion-Introversion (E-I): Prefer to focus on the outer world or your own inner world?
    - Sensing-Intuition (S-N): Prefer to focus on basic information you perceive or to interpret and add meaning?
    - Thinking-Feeling (T-F): Prefer to look at logic/consistency or look at values, relationships, and circumstances?
    - Judging-Perceiving (J-P): Prefer structure, schedules, and plans or to stay open to new information or options?

### Understanding people

The Big 5: Personality test grounded in theory developed from interviews across thousands of individuals

1) Openness to experience
2) Conscientiousness
3) Extroversion
4) Agreeableness
5) Neuroticism

### Personality tests

Help to reveal our differences

- Laid back or lack motivation?
- The way they **talk to themselves** is **annoying and distracting** (a way of thinking)
- Stay up-to-date or prefer not to fix what's not broken?

Differences in a team environment can lead to

- Misunderstanding
- Miscommunication
- Frustration
- Resentment

Feeling get *hurt*. Communications *break down*. Productivity, morale, and profits *drop*

### Types

Types influence

- Thinking
- Decision making
- Organization

All aspects of individual personality that will affect group dynamics

The more type preferences in common, generally observe greater satisfaction over *communication*

Alignments on indicators like Sensing-Intuition lead to *immediate* feelings of compatibility

## Strategies for getting along

Remember...

- Personality types are fluid. Your type today may not be the same in 2, 5, or 10 years
- Personality type **does not** excuse you from a particular type of work
- Personality type **does not** define who you are as an individual or member of a team
