## People management 

### Human resources

- US ranks #1 in productivity when calculating GDP per worker
- US is not #1 when calculating GDP per hours worked

> Twice as many Americans than Europeans work more than 48 hours per week

> Europeans average 6-7 weeks of paid leave. US average after 5 years is 15 days

### Surroundings

- Surrounding can affect the attitude of workers
- Open, colorful, and natural-lit places are nice
- Monotone, structured, and artificially lit places are not so nice

## Resource management

Resource management is about managing people and ensuring that they do what they are hired to do

- Define roles, responsibilities, and reporting rules
- Acquire personnel, assign to above
- **But also** develop team skills, foster growth, and mentorship
- Track performance, **motivation**, feedback and conflict resolution
