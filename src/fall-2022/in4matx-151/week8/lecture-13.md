# Lecture 13: More People Management

### Motivation

- **Intrinsic** motivation = people do things for their own enjoyment
- **Extrinsic** motivation = people do things to avoid a penalty or for a reward

Maslow hierarchy of needs

1) Self actualization: Vitality, creativity, self-sufficiency, authentcity, playfulness, and meaningfulness
2) Self esteem
3) Love and belongingness
4) Safety and security
5) Physiological needs: Air, water, food, shelter, sleep

McClelland's acquired needs theory

1) Achievement: Need to have challenging projects; regular feedback from management and peers
2) Affiliation: Desire harmonious relationships; need a cooperative work environment
3) Power: Should have the oppurtunity to manage others

McGregor's theory X and theory Y

- Theory X
    - Assumes workers dislike work
    - Requires coercion, threats, and control
- Theory Y
    - Assumes workers consider work natural
    - Self-esteem and self-actualization
- Theory Z
    - Emphasizes trust, quality, collective decision making cultural values

Generally, data consistently showed

- Projects are more likely to fail if project managers rely on **authority, money, or penalty**
- Projects were more likely to succeed if project managers relied on work **challenges and expertise**

Some techniques

- Observe and communicate (listen)
- Performance appraisals
- Conflict management

## Diversity in teams

### What is diversity?

Individual differences between individuals on any attributes that may lead to the perception that another person is different from self can be

- Demographic
- Religious
- Sexual orientation
- Mental
- Physical health and abilities
- Personality traits or personal values

### Diverse teams are smarter

- Diverse teams tend to lead to positive outcomes
- Diverse teams have been shown to result in hight revenue, more customers, and greater profits
- Diverse teams are more likely to introduce radical innovations and new products
- Collective intelligence is higher when average member intelligence is higher then maximum member intelligence
    - **NOT** related
        - Group cohesion
        - Motivation
        - Satisfaction
    - Teams who perform the best
        - **NOT** related to individual intelligence
        - Higher social sensitivity
        - Demonstrated balanced conversational turn-taking
        - CI positively correlated with the proportion of females in the group

### Diversity is good, but

- Heterogeneity in teams **has been** shown to reduce **cohesivenss, leads to conflicts** and misunderstandings
- Results in lower employee **satisfaction, othering** behavior and turnover
- These outcomes can be avoided when **leaders** are prepared

### Diversity works best when **values** are **shared**

- Some evidence to suggest that differing values lead to greater conflict compared to differing ideas
- Ignoring differences to increase harmony may not produce the desired results
- Respect and inclusion lead to the best performing teams
    - Attend to different viewpoints
    - Attend to your baises and recognize when they are influencing team behavior

### Overlooking disability

- Disability is not always visible or permanent
- Disabilities do affect the way we interact with and use technologies
- By not considering disability, project teams risk isolating or creating unnecesary barriers to portion of society
- Team diversity should include people with disability
