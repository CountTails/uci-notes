# Lecture 10: User orientation (part 2)

## Interviews and observations of end users

- Talk to the people that will be using the software
- Observer how they interact with their environment

## Personas

- Fake profiles that cover stereotypical users
- Includes
    - A label
    - A name
    - A profile

## Scenarios

- Text-based story about goal/motivation
- How will using the software help?

## Storyboards

- Similar to scenarios, but picture based
- Offer view of wider context and environment

## Wireframes and mockups

- Skeleton of UI
- Communicate vision of UI to the customer

## Design guidelines

- Help with
    - Consistency
    - Usability
- Consist of
    - Visual style guide
    - Reusable UI widgets

## Heuristic evaluation

- Research to improve usability

### Nielson guidelines

- Visibility of system status: keep user informed about what software is doing
- Match between system and real world: relate to real world / physical objects
- User control and freedom: assume mistakes happen, include clear navigation like undo/redo buttons
- Consistency and standards: Use symbols appropriately, follow platform conventions
- Error prevention: disable functionalities until safe to perform
- Recognition > recall: Reduce the users memory load
- Accelerators: Speed up actions for hardcore users (keyboard shortcuts)
- Minimalist design: Use the minimum number of widgets required for the UI
- Recognize/recover from errors: Provide user with ways to see and recover from errors
- Help and documentation: Helpful pop-ups or a support site

## User testing

- Congnitive walkthrough of users using the software
- Should include
    - Who is using
    - What is being used
    - What task should be performed
    - When the session takes place
    - What measures should be taken
