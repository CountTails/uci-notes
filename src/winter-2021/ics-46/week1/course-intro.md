# Course introduction

## Course logistics

### Grading

| Artifact | Weight |
|:--------:|:-------:|
| Setup project | 3% |
| Five projects | 45% (9% each) |
| One final project | 18% |
| Eight problem sets | 24% (3% each) |
| Online decorum | 10% |

### Class meetings

- Completely remote
- Dedicated to live Q&A
- Course lectures are pre-recorded
- Project guides / exercise sets / notes on course website
- Go to lab meetings for 1-on-1 help

## Where you've been

- Relatively simple programming problems are not a problem
- Be able to take an abstract description and turn it into a solution

### C++

- Basic built in data types
- Basic expressions, operators, and control structures
- Header and source files (with understanding of separate compilation)
- Objects, references, pointers and memory management
- Stack and heap allocations
- Meaning of the `const` keyword
- Built in data structures (like array or `std::vector`)
- Iterators from the standard library
- Built-in algorithms (like `std::find` and `std::for_each`)
- Classes, inheritance and polymorphism
- Virtual functions, pure functions, abstract base classes and making classes "well behaved"

## What this course is about

- Understanding and evaluating tradeoffs inherent when implementing data structures and algorithms
- Implementing data structures and algorithms
