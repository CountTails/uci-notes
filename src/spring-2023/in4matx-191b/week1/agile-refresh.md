# Agile refresh

## Backlog refinement

- Updating backlog to reflect current understanding of the project
	- Adding new user stories; remove deprecated ones
	- Updating estimates, fixing problems in stories, managing dependencies
- Should happen regularly within an agile team
	- An ongoing process: ~10% of development time
- Big refinements best as a whole team meeting, small refinements are ongoing
- Sprint planning cannot be successful without a good backlog

## Refinement goals

1) Ensure that backlog items are complete, current, and well documented
2) Identify and manage dependencies
3) Ensure that priorities and estimates are current and agreed upon
4) Sort backlog based on priorities

## Invest in user stories

- **I**ndependent: avoid dependencies when possible
- **N**egotiable: does not pre-determine the implementation
- **V**aluable: produces real value for the client
- **E**stimable: can predict how long development will take
- **S**mall: typically 3-4 days of work max
- **T**estable: clear criteria for when the item is done

## Avoid task-oriented user stories

- Avoid generic user as your role
- Should not be a required step toward a separate goal
- Users are happier when they get something for nothing
- Filling out a form, clicking a button, logging in are not user stories
	- Not *valuable*
	- Not *negotiable*

## Evaluation criteria

- Project management and collaboration
	- Most important part
- Good communication in teams and with sponsors
- Quality of deliverables
	- Code, designs, etc
	- Content + comments, documentation, etc.
- Individual participation and engagement
	- Everyone should write some code
	- Note: Trello and GitHub activity logs are checked
