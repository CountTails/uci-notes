# Course Introduction

## Programming languages

- A universe of design ideas
	- Baked into programming languages
	- Bundled in libraries
	- Exists as idioms and programming styles
- Language design concepts often pop out into systems design concepts
	- Map reduce (Lisp)
	- Statelessness (REST)

## Programming styles

- Tend to be more generic than languages
	- Languages are what happen when a style is **enforced**
- Styles can exist in languages as a non-frozen construct
	- OOP in C
- Constraints: things you **must not** do
- Principled decisions: Things **you must** do

## History of PLs

- Most concepts were "invented" between 1940's - 1970's
	- Few in the 1980's, even less in the 1990's
	- Lots of detail work, combinations, and optimizations
- Some concepts get baked into languages; others are just floating around
- People reinvent things when the context is right

> Know the past to understand the present

## Where this course stands

- A bit of program design
- Mostly focusing on programming language design
- **Not** covering compilers and interpreters
- We will cover how programming languages influence program design and vise-versa

### Where you've been -- application code

- Passive use of familiar concepts
- Focus on functional correctness
- Blindness with respect to abstraction opportunities
- Obliviousness with respect to
	- Performance
	- Extensibility
	- Evolution

### Where you're going -- library code

- Creation of concepts for others to use
- Focus on interface (what programmers see and how they use it)
- Take advantage of abstraction opportunities
- Care about *overall* performance, extensibility, evolution

## Course objectives

- Understand many advanced programming concepts
	- 100's available, all *look* different, but aren't really that different
	- Appreciate history, diversity of ideas
	- Be prepared for new languages
	- See beyond hype and sales pitches
- Learn some important facts about existing languages
- Learn to think critically about design trade-offs

## Learning outcomes

- Level up your programming skills
- Code for your **peers**
	- Go from an application programmer to a library or framework programmer
