## Reflecting on design

### Questions to identify mistakes

- What went well?
- What did not go well?
- What are you most worried about in terms of progress at this time?
- What would you like to do different?

> You must try to understand the problem first before starting to work out solutions for it

### Questions to help improve

- Did we discuss current processes?
- Did we consider who the audience is?
- Have we considered who the other stakeholders are?
- Have we talked about the experiences that people might have?

> Avoid mixing problem understanding and problem solving
