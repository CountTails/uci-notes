## Heuristic evaluation

> Heuristic evaluation is the process of **assessing a user interface against** a standard set of *criteria*

### Procedure

1) Choose heuristics
    - [Nielsen's heuristics of user interface design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
    - Gerhardt-Powals' cognitive engineering principles
    - Standards (accessibility, responsive design, color guides)
    - Internal, company guidelines
2) Choose evaluators
    - Choose the number of evaluators (3-5 typically)
    - Choose required background
3) Identify goal of the interface
4) Define a set of representative tasks
5) Perform tasks
6) Tabulate results

### Criteria for successful use

- The evaluators must be well-versed in the heuristics
- Application of multiple evaluators
- Requires attention to detail

### Strengths and weaknesses 

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Is based on best practices | Focuses on problems, does not identify opportunities |
| Useful to iron out problems before testing with real users | Will not uncover all problems, because of a focus on a given set of heuristics |
| Can be performed relatively quickly | |
| Can be used on early design artifacts | |
| Result sharing improves design practice | |
