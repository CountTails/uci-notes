## Storyboarding

> Storyboarding is the process of **visually communicating expected interactions** in context

### Procedure

1) Decide upon interaction
2) Decide upon story to be told
3) Decide upon level of artistic detail
4) Draw and annotate story
5) Iterate

### Criteria for successful use

- Develop short effective stories
- Apply a strong sense of aesthetics
- Must be open to storyboarding multiple ideas
- Should have a definite sense of possible solutions
- Collaborate

### Strengths and weaknesses

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Tangible nature invites early feedback | Stops well short of designing the actual interface in detail |
| Brings an increased focus on how the users might expect to interact with the product | It will be incomplete: might distance the designer from undocumented storyboards |
| Builds a shared understanding of the audience and interactions among the design team | Can be difficult to ensure that the storyboards represent the audience accurately |
| Provides an implicit baseline for future design ideas | |

## Prototyping

> Prototyping is process of creating **tangible artifacts embedding the envisioned design** solution

### Procedure

1) Decide the purpose
2) Decide the fidelity and medium
    - Low fidelity: paper prototype
    - Medium fidelity: wireframes and mock-ups
    - High fidelity: actual running software
3) Create the prototype

### Criteria for successful use

- Strong sense of aesthetics and attention to detail
- Must be open to prototyping multiple design ideas
- Should have a definite sense of possible solutions
- Collaborate

### Strengths and weaknesses

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Tangible nature invites early yet detailed feedback | The higher fidelity, the more expensive the endeavor |
|Low fidelity prototyping is a *lightweight* approach that sill yields *good results* | Could lead to too much focus on the visual appearance instead of the supporting the actual tasks at hand |
|Tool support is readily available | |
