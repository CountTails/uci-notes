## Abstractions

- An abstraction is formed by reducing the information content of a concept or an observable phenomenon, typically to retain only information which is relevant for a particular purpose
    - Choice of what to include
    - Choice of what not to include
- Each abstraction makes some information readily available at the expense of obscuring or removing other information
