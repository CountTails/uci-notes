## Mind mapping

> Mind mapping is the process of generating ideas and developing concepts when the underlying relationships are unclear

### Procedure

1) Identify the focus word or question
2) Free associate outward from the focus
3) **Reorganize as needed**: *here is where criticisms acts*
4) **Annotate**: *what does that mean for my design work?*

### Criteria for successful use

- The designer must possess, or have access to people with **strong domain knowledge**
- Relies on early insight into the design problem, and what dimensions might matter
- One should not dismiss ideas (*generate first, consolidate later*)
- Collaborate

### Strings and weaknesses

| Strengths | Weakness |
| --------- | -------- |
| Can be used for many different purposes | May become too disconnected from reality |
| Fluid representation suitable for tool use | May become too unwieldy in size and complexity |
| Builds common understanding and language | Generation of ideas is restricted by the hierarchical form of representation |
| Can uncover "hidden" relationships | Requires a (well-trained) moderator |
| Lightweight | |

### Variants

- Concept mapping
- Silent mind mapping
    - The same as mind mapping, but first people work isolated for a few minutes
    - Very powerful method for generating new ideas
    - Helps to avoid some people to dominate the discussion: *more ideas, more contribution, more diversity, more complete maps*

## Morphological chart

> Morphological chart is the process of generating ideas in an **analytical and systematic manner**

### Procedure

1) List the features or functions that are essential to the product
2) For each feature or function, list the means by which it might be achieved (derive these systematically)
3) Identify feasible combinations (not all partial ideas will fit well, resulting in a harmonic design)

### Criteria for successful use

- The various features or functions of the eventual design solution must be well understood
- The various features of functions of the eventual design solution must be relatively independent
- The various means per feature or function must not be infinite, and principally relate to one another so a systematic articulation can uncover all of them

### Strengths and weaknesses

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Helps break down the design problem into features or functions | Applicable only to design problems where the features or functions of the design solution are well understood |
| Systematic manner of deriving possible alternatives | Quickly leads to too many possible combinations |
| Avoids possible bias toward certain means | No valuation attached to individual alternatives |
| Helps identify and consider novel/unusual combinations | |
