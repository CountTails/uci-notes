## Role playing

> Role playing is the process of **acting out the experience of a user** with the envisioned design solution

### Procedure

1) Identify the situation, tasks, and roles
2) Enact the situation and tasks
3) Take notes

### Criteria for successful use

- The people involved in role play must be willing to improvise
- The people involved in role play must be willing to "truly" step into the user role
- The scenario and tasks should be played out multiple times
- Notes should be taken by an auxiliary person
- Prototypes may help

### Strengths and weaknesses

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Helps the designer envision the user experience more vividly | Depends strongly on people's willingness to role play and not be self-conscious in doing so |
| Can be used to enact situations and tasks to which the designer does not have direct access | Depends strongly on people's imagination, and understanding of the typical (and atypical) user |
| May uncover assumptions that are not readily apparent in more traditional design artifacts | Difficult to do well for software |
| Relatively lightweight method | |

## Wizard of Oz

> Wizard of Oz is the process of evaluating an envisioned design solution during which the user interacts with a system that is seemingly real, but actually involves a person who generates the system responses from behind the scenes

### Procedure

1) Identify the situation and tasks
2) Create the physical environment
3) Enact the situation and tasks
4) Take notes

### Criteria for successful use

- The experience must be realistic
- The "wizard" must behave consistently
- Tasks do not involve direct manipulation

### Strengths and weaknesses

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Identifies problems with the design concept early | Requires training of the wizard |
| Can evaluate design solutions that are difficult to prototype | Difficult to provide the realism and consistency necessary |
| Can involve actual future users | Can only simulate relatively simple experiences |
| Relatively inexpensive | Difficult to mimic all types of software |
