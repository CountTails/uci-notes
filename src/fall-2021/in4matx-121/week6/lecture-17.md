## Contextual inquiry

> Contextual inquiry is the process of **observing and interviewing a user in context** -- while they are engaged in the actual setting of life that might be impacted by your future change in the world

## Procedure

1) Plan
    - Decide, beforehand, the purpose of the contextual inquiry
    - What type of information, settings and users
2) Identify users
    - Draw an advertisement in the newspaper
    - Social media recruiting
    - Ask client for access to representative users
    - Use an external recruitment service to target particular (typically representative) demographics
3) Schedule and conduct visits
    - 2-3 hour visit
    - Master-apprentice model
        - Observer takes note of what the user does
        - User shares their thoughts on the work they perform
        - Observer inquires why the user does what they do
        - Observer takes notes
    - Ideally, a contextual inquiry becomes a rich conversation
        - Shared stories and insights
        - Clarified interpretations
4) Analyze the data
    - 90% of the time, the existing software is used one way, but 10% of the time, an exceptional use occurs
    - A small number of users circumvent the existing software system by passing paper notes back and forth
    - Users of the future software system have goals that do not align with management's goal

## Criteria for successful use

- Access to the "right" users involved in the "right" activities
- Extensive sharing
- Ability to expand inquiry
- A strong focus on **why and why not** questions

## Strengths and weaknesses

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Reveals underlying and often invisible work structure | Users may not know the answers to the important questions |
| Involves actual users | Steeped in current practices, perhaps stifling creativity |
| Exposes rationale | Observer bias |
| Can challenge assumptions held by the designer | Lessons that can be learned depend strongly on the activities being performed by the user |
| Not as involved as a full ethnography, but can still yield very usable insights and results | Stops short of analysis |

## Variants

- Contextual design
- Questionnaire
- Ethnography
- Interview
