## Design method

- A **self-contained**, structured **technique** that guides a designer in advancing some aspect of the design project at hand
- Serves as a bridge from the overall process of design to actual individual and collaborative design work

## Characteristic of design methods

- **Each design method suits a specific purpose** with respect to the design cycle and overall design project
- Each design method expects a certain context for it to lead to optimal results
- **Applying just one design methods rarely suffices** but still may help
