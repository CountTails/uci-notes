# Notebook Preface

Welcome to my school notebook! This notebook serves as a record of my academic journey, where I document my thoughts, notes, and ideas on various subjects. It's not just a collection of papers; it's a glimpse into my learning process and growth. Whether you are a fellow student, a teacher, or just a curious reader, I invite you to explore the pages within and join me in this educational adventure.

## Purpose of this Notebook

This notebook is a space for me to organize my thoughts and make connections between concepts across my academic journey. Notes in this notebook were jotted down *outside* of scheduled class time, to ensure proper ingestion of course content. I quickly found it difficult to take notes during class time as I would concentrate on taking good notes and would miss something important that the instructor said. By taking notes on my own, it gave me a chance to actually pay attention to lectures rather than scramble to capture information

## Organization

This notebook is organized by term. Since UCI operates on a quarter system, there are 3 terms that take place during the traditional school year and the occasional summer term. Each term has a dedicated section for a class that I took during said term. The class cover acts more like a syllabus and has links to all notes that are present for the class. In each class, notes are organized chronologically as they were taken through the term.

My notes are plain markdown files. I choose this format because I found it quite natural to quickly structure a note into a digestable way. It also helped that the notes were still readable even if I did not have access to a markdown renderer. If you are viewing this on the web, the markdown files in this notebook were rendered by [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).

## About the Author

I am a recent graduate from UCI who has always wanted to help others learn. During my K-12 school years, I was considered a "gifted" student. That meant I hardly had to study for any class and still managed to pass all of my classes. Even taking several AP courses a year in high school didn't really change that. It wasn't until I got to college that the speed and depth of a course finally got to me and manifested as flat out failing my first higher education exam. That is when I decided to change the way I consumed knowledge. To learn more about me, check out [my portfolio](https://www.ncm.dev).
