# UX and agile requirements

## Human centered design

> Highly usable systems tend to be mor successful both technically and commercially

- UX can improve user experience and system adoption
- UX may reduce softare development costs in the long term

## Philosophy of design

> YOU ARE **NOT** THE USERS

### People

- Human capabilities
- Tasks and goals
- Culture and society

### Technologies

- Techinical capabilities
- Representation
- Constraints and affordances

## Key questions in UX

- Who are the users and stakeholders?
- What are their needs and requirements?
- What are the social and cultural considerations?
- Where do we find users to test our design?
- How do we measure user experience/usability?
- How do we ensure systems are ethical accessible?

### Who will be using this system?

- The first important question to discuss with your partner
- More even so than what the project would do
- Who are the direct and indirect stakeholdres?
- What roles do they play?
- What do you know about them?

## UX toolkit

### Discovery

- Tools
    - Competitor analysis
    - Interviews
    - Contextual inquiry
    - Serveys
    - Personas
        - Depict archetypal users representing the needs of a larger group
        - Segment users based on how they use a tool
            - Abstract, fictional representations of each user segment
            - User profile describes goals, taks, workflow, pain points, etc
            - Based on data (i.e., real people)
        - Provide a conreate basis to guide decisions
            - Make assumptions about users explicit
            - Are generative -- you can project personas into new situations!
    - Use cases
    - Scenarios
    - User journey maps
        - Map the relationship between the customer and an organization over time
        - Often include
            - Scenarios or phases: context and sequence of events
            - Touch points: what customers do while interacting and how they do it
            - Channels: where they perform actions
            - Thoughts and feelings: what the customer thinks and feels
        - Often starts at "Awareness" -- before relationship exists
        - Focuses on the person's journey with the organization
            - Your app may only be a small part of that journey
    - Workflow diagrmas
    - Ethics exploration
- People
    - Begins with understanding them
    - Goes beyond functional requirements
        - How will this system fit into people's lives?
        - What is the experience, from before they start using the system until after its over?
    - UX is "full stack"

### Info architecture

- Content audit
- Sitemaps
- Structural diagramming
- Card sorting
- Search optimization
- Taxonomies
- Internationalization

### Ideation and design

- Sketching
- Storyboards
- Wireframes
- Paper prototypes
- Interactive prototyping
- High-fidelity mockups

### Evaulation

- Heuristic evaluation
- Cognitive walkthrough
- User testing
- A/B testing
- User analytics
- Accessibility reviews

## Requirements

> **what** the software should do without saying **how** it should do it
> address customer **needs**, not their *wants*

### Specification

- Serves as the fundamental reference point between customer and sofware producer
- In agile
    - Early/continuous delivery of functionality to customer
    - Short, incremental RE cycles, each followed by a short implementation cycle
    - Utilize user stories
        - Human-centered way or representing requirements
        - Each story represents a "unit of value"
        - Stories can be nested or heirarchical
    - Basic: `As a <role> I want <activity> so that <valuable outcome>`
    - Epics (start here)
        - Highest level of user stories
        - Broad and define context
        - Represent areas of functionality of the system (the "feature comparison" level)
        - Distilling epics
            - Break into granular form
            - Multiple stories per epic

### Backlog

- Made of user stories
- Typical/useful for an agile approach
