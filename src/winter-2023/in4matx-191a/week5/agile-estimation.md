# Agile estimations

## What are estimates?

- A sense of how long it will take to complete each individual task in a backlog
- Useful for deciding how many tasks in each sprint
- Can be used to track overall progress and productivity

## Why they suck

- **Accurate estimates are impossible**. Too many unknowns and potential surprises
- **Estimates mostly help managers.** It's not clear how much they benefit the deveopers themselves
- **Estimates con't be guarantees.** If estimates are treated as promises, developers will pad their estimates and they'll be even less accurate
- **Estimate is a form of waste**. Time spent estimating is time not spent developing

## Why bother estimating

- Having some idea of how much work is often better than having no idea
- Estimates get better with practice
- Provide a metric that can be tracked over time
- Helps th developer team have a *coversation* about effort

## How to estimate

1) Have a conversation with the team when you are creating backlog
2) Discuss what is needed
3) Assign a team member(s)

## Types of estimates

### Time-based estimates

- Assign an estimate based on how long you think it will take to complete a task, usually in number of hours
- Potential issues
    - Suggests a level of accuracy and precision that may be misleading
    - Are often interpreted by outsiders as guarantees
    - Can drive teams to spend to much time trying to make the estimates accurate

### Story points

- Relative estimation: the numbers are only meaningful in relation to themselves
- Many use a (modified) Fibonacci sequence
    - $1,\, 2,\, 3,\, 5,\, 8,\, 13,\, 20,\, 30,\, 50,\, 80$
    - Estimates increase by about the same proprotion at each step
- Challenges
    - Complexity
    - Shared understanding

### T-shirt sizes

- Good way to get started -- easy to adopt
- Assign essentially a bucket for how big a task is
- Challenges
    - Shared understanding
    - Not really additive -- how many smalls equal one XL?
    - Difficult for longer-term progress tracking

## Getting going with estimation

- At first, estimations won't be super meaningful outside of the individual tasks
- A burndown chart can show actual vs ideal estimates
- Can reveal some patterns
    - Underestimation -- ideal below actual
    - Scope creep -- ideal falls under actual while actual grows
    - Plateau -- ideal falls under actual while actual stagnates

## Estimation in your projects

- Choose an estimation format
- All backlog items should get an estimate
- Estimates are expected in sprint reports

### Methods

- **One-at-a-time**: consider each backlog item separately, discuss, assign a value
- **Affinity grouping**: put all items into groups of similar effort, then assign values to the groups
- **Ordering protocol**: randomly order items, then each person takes a turn moving an item up or down. Continue until all pass and list is ordered by effort. Assigne values.
- **Dot voting**: each person gets a set number of dots to assign. More dots means more effort. Everyone assigns their own dots, then totoal dots used to assign value.
