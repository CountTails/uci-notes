## APIs

- **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface
- A software intermediary that allows applications to talk to each other
- The API is the interface that runs and deliver data from an application you're using to systems over the internet

## PCBs

- **P**rinted **C**ircuit **B**oard
- Allows signals and power to be routed between physical devices
- Consists of alternating layers of different materials laminated together with heat and adhesive

## LEDs

- **L**ight **E**mitting **D**iode
- Covert eletrical energy to light energy
- More energy efficient than traditional light bulb
- Only allow current to flow in one direction
- Brightness is dependent on how much current it draws
