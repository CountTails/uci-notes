# CS 161 Syllabus

## Course description

Name: Design and Analysis of Algorithms

Units: 4

Summary: Techniques for efficient algorithm design, including divide-and-conquer and dynamic programming, and time/space analysis. Fast algorithms for problems applicable to networks, computer games, and scientific computing, such as sorting, shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, network flow, and pattern matching.
