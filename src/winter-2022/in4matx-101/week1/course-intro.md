# Course introduction

## Course expectations

### Computers

- A general machine
- Made of the following pieces
    - Processor
    - Memory
    - Inputs (keyboard, mouse)
    - Outputs (display, printer)
    - Persistent storage
    - Network connection

### Programs

- Each program turns a computer into a specific machine
- There are many types of applications
    - Office automation: word processors, mail clients
    - Financial: Banking, payment network
    - Scientific: weather tracking, modeling and visualization tools
    - Entertainment: streaming services, gaming communities
    - Transportation: GPS, infotainment systems
    - Manufacturing: CAD, robotics
    - Medicine: CAT, MRI, X-Ray scanners
    - Embedded: Stoves, missiles and drones

### Programming

- The practice and creating and modifying computer programs
    - Analogous to writing books or creative art painting
    - Skilled writers/painters are much better than novices
    - But even novices can do something
- Has become a fundamental skill
    - Comparable to reading, writing, and math

### Languages

- Computers have only binary machine language that they understand
- Symbolic assembly eased programming, but could still be tedious
- Higher level languages were developed, each with their own trade-offs in
    - Efficiency
    - Writability
    - Readability
    - Modifiability
    - Expressiveness

## Succeeding in the course

### Course goals

- Languages change and new languages arise
    - The ability to learn new language *quickly* is a very valuable skill
- Appreciate trade-offs between languages
    - Avoid becoming a rabid fan of any particular language
- Deeper understanding of programming languages
    - Identify differences between languages like Python and C++
    - Note the similarity between languages like Python and Javascript
- Understand how language features are implemented
    - How is `switch` different from `if-else`
- What are options for each language feature
    - Trade-offs between static and dynamic storage allocation

### Learning from a course

- Programming is mostly problem solving
    - Requires a lot of thinking
    - Thinking is hard
- Should practice active learning
    - Lectures will include activities to engage the class
    - Watching the lecture is not enough
    - The online version will be even more of a challenge

### A typical week

- Course structure
    - Reading quizzes to learn the basic stuff through the readings
    - Lectures introduce concepts with relevant examples and activities
    - Lecture quizzes to help digest and apply what was covered in lecture
    - Homework will require writing of multiple programs
    - Homework quizzes will apply what was learned from completing the homework
    - Labs will contain learning activities to be completed with a partner
    - Group discussion will help each other learn
    - Final exam will evaluate if the learning persist
- Evaluation
    - Straight scale of course score computed from the weighted sum of work (no curve)
    - One option for extra credit on the final homework assignment

### Helpful suggestions

- Always write on paper a rough sketch of each program
- Never copy and paste form other sources
- Don't even look at example while you're developing your program
